# Introduction

This is a library of missing data imputation algorithms written in Python3.

Data can be missing from a dataset for various reasons. Dependent upon the specific reason a cell is missing, we will have to treat each missing value differently.

# Methods

** Simple Random Imputation: ** Fill in missing values with a randomly select value from the same column. Not very useful, but acts as a good baseline.
